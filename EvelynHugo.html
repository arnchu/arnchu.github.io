								<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now? Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career. Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in ‘80s, and of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great, forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story nears its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways. Written with Reid’s signature talent for creating “complex, likeable characters” (Real Simple), this is a mesmerising journey through the splendor of old Hollywood into the harsh realities of the present day as two women struggle with what it means – and costs – to face the truth.</p>
							  <p><strong>My review :</strong> The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is not the sort of book that I would normally read and yet, it is undoubtedly the best book I’ve read in recent memory. Sold as a historical romance, the book follows the spellbinding tale of Evelyn Hugo, a young actress, who is determined to leave her mark during the Golden age of Hollywood. Armed with her boundless ambition and ability to captivate, Evelyn is unapologetic about doing what it takes reach the top. Make no mistake, this is not the tragic story of a sultry actress burdened by fame but, rather a celebration of what it means to be human. </p>
							  <p>Evelyn Hugo is one of the most richly nuanced characters that I have ever encountered; one moment she is ruthless, scheming and cold-hearted and the next she is compassionate and oh, so painfully human. Beneath the guise of fame and success, her story transcends time and resonates with all of us as we see a bit of ourselves in her struggles and triumphs. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo serves as a powerful exploration of race, sexuality, sexism and the pressure to conform to societal standards. Upon finishing this story, I felt reflective, wistful and touched by how many things can happen in life that are both awful and wondrous. This book was a reminder that life is too short to pretend to be someone you’re not and that, we shouldn’t spend it doing anything than being true to ourselves and the people we loveOverall, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was an intoxicating read that is as beautifully constructed as it is utterly captivating. </p>
							  <p><strong>Notable Themes and Ideas: </strong>It was a cautionary tale of how love can be situational and how relationship dynamics are not static. The notion of friendship and companionship as a valid form of love was also an interesting idea that I had not seen explored so thoroughly before. &nbsp;I found it ironic that to remain true to herself Evelyn had to spin a web of lies to protect herself and the people around her. Finally, it was a riveting portrayal of a woman who lived her life being two people, trying to reconcile the two - torn between who she was and being what society allowed her to be. (Side Note: This brings to mind a quote from the Nightingale, “If I have learned anything in this long life of mine, it is this: in love we find out who we want to be; in war we find out who we are")</p>
							  <p><strong>Memorable lines:</strong> “When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things.” <br>
						      </p>
							  <p>People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy. </p>
							  <p><strong>Rating: 10/10 </strong>This book challenged some of my values and made me reconsider my perceptions surrounding morality, friendship and fame. This story was a reminder that there is much to learn from literary characters and witnessing Evelyn rise above her circumstances and &nbsp;reclaim her cultural and sexual identity was both cathartic and empowering. <br>
